It first review some basic concepts of the Linear Algebra, such as Eigenvalues & EigenVectors, SVD, PCA. Then it introduce some numerical linear algebra methods to solve the linear equations. After that, he introduce the Low-Rank Approximation methods, which are important in current LLM, using to fine-tuning the models. In the end, it introduce the optimization algorithms such as gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, which are basic idea in the optimization in the neural network.\nThis course is important, after harness those tools and algorithms, you can easily understand the complex equations in the AI papers.\n\n\n\nMIT 18.01 Course Website: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/\nMIT 18.01 Course Video: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL590CCC2BC5AF3BC1\nMIT 18.02 Course Website: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/\nMIT 18.02 Couse Video: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4C4C8A7D06566F38\nCalculus are important in the optimization algorithms.
